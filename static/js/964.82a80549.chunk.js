I can also evaluate the statistical rigor of my team\u2019s analyses and make appropriate recommendations.\n\n# ML Design\n- I formulate business objectives as computational tasks using the right approach for each objective.\n- I provide critical feedback to other members of my team through the lifecycle of an ML project.\n- I critique existing metrics and define new offline and online metrics that stay valid throughout the model\u2019s lifetime.\n- I define an experimentation strategy, and adapt my team\u2019s roadmap to reflect significant findings.\n\n# Code Fluency\n- I write code that captures the essential nature of the solution and is appropriately flexible, reusable, efficient, and adaptable to changing requirements.\n- I ensure high code quality in code reviews.\n- I have a strong awareness of the ecosystem of tools and libraries supporting my primary programming language and development environment and a strong grasp of the idioms and patterns of my language. I may be intimately familiar with the open source community surrounding it.\n\n# Software Design\n- I am able to give quality feedback on designs written by other members of my team, asking probing, insightful questions that solidify choices and surface erroneous assumptions\n- I effectively and quickly debug cross-module issues, and may intuit where bugs might lie due to my deep knowledge of the libraries, platforms, and systems that my software relies on \n\n# Responsibilities\n- I deliver many of my team\u2019s goals on time and with a high standard of quality\n- My understanding of the business context and my team\u2019s goals enable me to have the greatest customer impact and allows me to make independent technical decisions in the face of open-ended requirements\n- I can identify when my results aren't moving the needle for our business/team goals or serving the needs of customers in a meaningful way and work with manager to redirect my focus\n- I get work to a simple place by focusing on the heart of the problem and prioritizing the right things\n- I proactively identify new opportunities and advocate for and implement improvements to the current state of projects \u2014 potentially having broader business impact across teams or products\n- I make informed decisions by consulting the right stakeholders and balancing details with the big picture \n\n\n\n# Selected Blogs\n\n- [Real time Face Recognition Using Facenet](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/real-time-face-recognition-using-facenet-ishwar-sawale/)\n- [Indian Festival Recognition App](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/indian-festival-recognition-app-ishwar-sawale/)\n- [Writing command Line REST API client in Go lang](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/writing-command-line-rest-api-client-go-lang-ishwar-sawale/)\n- [Neural Style Transfer App](https://medium.com/@ishwarsawale/neural-style-transfer-app-7d5feb3df422)\n- [AI Chat-Bot for Productivity](https://medium.com/@ishwarsawale/ai-chat-bot-for-productivity-5ce72a1eac87)\n",c=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,m=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,(0,a.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(r.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn more",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",c," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(o(),{source:d,renderers:{Link:m},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
