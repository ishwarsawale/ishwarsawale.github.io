The Economist’s leader column is a fundamental and fascinating concept. It permits the media organization to ingest their
stance on a specific topic and to gauge consequences of news items with a magnifying glass. Each leader story accounts
for one page in the paper. The US Election, Brexit, industries in transformation, all those are instances of topics leaders embraced.
They are brazing and prevailing affairs in the present news landscape. To a greater or lesser extent,
a leader settles a score with something, which usually isn’t just going away tomorrow or next week.
With the medium of those leader stories comes attached the company’s most important product:
an exegesis on how to fathom the world and many times a recommendation or advice to the leaders of
the world. Atop, the remarkable team of authors delivers those in a single voice – there are no bylines in the paper. 

In an age of increased acceleration of the news flow and alternative facts,
The Economist delivers this product, unparalleled. Amid all this, there
is a student of data journalism and a desire to understand what rules and
customs it takes to master the art of composing better journalism narratives,
and something he is sure of the leader embodies in all its facets.
What is the secret formula to follow in line with the paradigm of a leader story, and crack the enigma of fine	 contemporary journalism?

## Leader’s Compound
Let us investigate an exemplar of a leader story, to learn about its peculiarities
and mannerisms. “The litter of the law” in this weeks issue will suffice to elucidate
structure and composition. Discussed is the Dodd-Frank act and the story weights up the
appropriateness for the US administration to reassess the law.



### The News Peg
This item is a requisite. Failing its possession, could drag on its entitlement. In our case, the president signed an executive order urging the treasury to conduct a 120-day review of America’s financial regulations. A page earlier, the leader “Time to pick up the tab” is pegged to the occasion that Britain’s House of Commons voted to approve the process of withdrawal. The leader “Courting Russia”, signs for intentions to forge a totally new strategic alignment by the US presidency, we can acknowledge as such, allowing it to be contemporary. The news peg doesn’t seem to be requested in the first instance. Though many times, this is where one could well mount it.

### Paragraphs
“An Economist paper article should be decoded by simply reading the first or second sentence of each paragraph”, once someone from the paper shared.  We find this patterns accredited, post introduction. Each paragraph consists of a leading claim communicating the section’s sentiment.
