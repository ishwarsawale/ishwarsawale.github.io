    "# NLP. Text generation with Markov chains\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language generation means creating new text based on some given raw text. Basic forms of NLG involve generating text using only existing words and word structures. More advanced systems include sintactic realizers, which ensure that new text follows grammatic rules, or text planners, which help arrange sentences, paragraphs and other components of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatical text generation can be used for a variety of tasks, among others:\n",
    "- Automatic documentation generation;\n",
    "- Automatic reports from raw data;\n",
    "- Explanations in expert systems;\n",
    "- Medical informatics;\n",
    "- Machine translation between natural languages;\n",
    "- Chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of Markov chains is that future state of the system can be predicted based solely on the current state. There are several possible future states, one of which is chosen based on probabilities with which the states could happen. Markov chains are used in physics, economics, speech recognition and in many other areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we apply Markov chains to NLG, we can generate text based on the idea that next possible word can be predicted on N previous words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I'll start with generating text based only on one previous word, and then will try to improve the quality of predictions."
