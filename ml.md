# Data science portfolio by Ishwar Sawale

This portfolio is a compilation of portfolio_notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## Classification problems.

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

[Github](https://github.com/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Titanic.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Titanic.ipynb)

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.

### Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!

[Github](https://github.com/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/GGG.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/GGG.ipynb)

Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo! is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem: based on information about monsters we predict their types. A fun competition for Halloween. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo).
This dataset has little number of samples, so careful feature selection and model ensemble are necessary for high accuracy.

### Otto Group Product Classification Challenge

[Github](https://github.com/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Otto_Group.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Otto_Group.ipynb)

Otto Group Product Classification Challenge is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem. Based on information about products we predict their category. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge).
The data is obfuscated, so the main questionlies in the selection of the model for prediction.

### Imbalanced classes

[Github](https://github.com/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Imbalanced.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Imbalanced.ipynb)

In real world it is common to meet data in which some classes are more common and others are rarer. In case of a serious disbalance prediction rare classes could be difficult using standard classification methods. In this notebook I analyse such a situation. I can't share the data, used in this analysis.

### Bank card activations

[Github](https://github.com/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Card_activation.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Card_activation.ipynb)

Banks strive to increase the efficiency of their contacts with customers. One of the areas which require this is offering new products to existing clients (cross-selling). Instead of offering new products to all clients, it is a good idea to predict the probability of a positive response. Then the offers could be sent to those clients, for whom the probability of response is higher than some threshold value.
In this notebook I try to solve this problem.

## Regression problems.

### House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

[Github](https://github.com/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/House_Prices.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/House_Prices.ipynb)

House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a regression problem: based on information about houses we predict their prices. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
The dataset has a lot of features and many missing values. This gives interesting possibilities for feature transformation and data visualization.

### Loan Prediction

[Github](https://github.com/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Loan_Prediction.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Loan_Prediction.ipynb)

Loan Prediction is a knowledge and learning hackathon on Analyticsvidhya. Dream Housing Finance company deals in home loans. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. Based on customer's information we predict whether they should receive a loan or not. General description and data are available on [Analyticsvidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/).


### Caterpillar Tube Pricing

[Github](https://github.com/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Caterpillar.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Caterpillar.ipynb)

Caterpillar Tube Pricing is a competition on Kaggle. This is a regression problem: based on information about tube assemblies we predict their prices. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/caterpillar-tube-pricing).
Dataset consists of many files, so there is an additional challenge in combining the data snd selecting the features.

## Natural language processing.

### Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn

[Github](https://github.com/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Bag_of_Words.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Bag_of_Words.ipynb)

Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn is a sentimental analysis problem. Based on texts of reviews we predict whether they are positive or negative. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial).
The data provided consists of raw reviews and class (1 or 2), so the main part is cleaning the texts.

### NLP with Python: exploring Fate/Zero

[Github](https://github.com/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Fate_Zero_explore.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ishwarsawale/ishwarsawale.github.io/blob/master/portfolio_notebooks/Fate_Zero_explore.ipynb)
