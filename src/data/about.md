# Intro
- I am a Data Scientist/ Machine Learning Engineer with 5+ years of experience in real-world datasets and business problem-solving.
- I have experience in AI product research and development; in the domain - Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision & Conversational Agents.
- I ensure the quality of ML systems for my team and ensure the validity of experimentation strategy and offline and online metrics for my team. 
- I am an expert in ML modeling, techniques, and toolkits and adapt my team’s work based on the latest developments in these fields.

# Currently
- I am currently working with Indegene Inc. Building Solution for Life Science Domain.

# Some history

- Previously I have worked with Mindstix Software Labs as a Solutions Architect Data Science, before that, I was working with Coriolis Technologies Pvt Ltd on Deep Learning & Computer Vision related applications.
- I have completed a Diploma in Big Data Analytics and Bachelor of Engineering from the University Of Pune.
- I have completed courses related to Machine Learning, AI from Udemy, Coursera, DataCamp, & LinkedIn Learning. 

# ML Fluency
- I have a deep understanding of a range of ML techniques (e.g., deep learning, optimization, regression, ensembles, tree based methods, dimensionality reduction, Bayesian modeling, etc.), area (CV, NLP, RL, etc.), or tool (sklearn, pytorch, tensorflow, etc.) and I select an optimal solution for my projects.
- I maintain strong awareness of the state of the art, and can select an appropriate algorithm, tool, or technique for a given problem, incorporating a broad understanding of various tradeoffs.
- I can analyze and present datasets or results of experiments while choosing the appropriate statistical methods and visualization techniques. I can also evaluate the statistical rigor of my team’s analyses and make appropriate recommendations.

# ML Design
- I formulate business objectives as computational tasks using the right approach for each objective.
- I provide critical feedback to other members of my team through the lifecycle of an ML project.
- I critique existing metrics and define new offline and online metrics that stay valid throughout the model’s lifetime.
- I define an experimentation strategy, and adapt my team’s roadmap to reflect significant findings.

# Code Fluency
- I write code that captures the essential nature of the solution and is appropriately flexible, reusable, efficient, and adaptable to changing requirements.
- I ensure high code quality in code reviews.
- I have a strong awareness of the ecosystem of tools and libraries supporting my primary programming language and development environment and a strong grasp of the idioms and patterns of my language. I may be intimately familiar with the open source community surrounding it.

# Software Design
- I am able to give quality feedback on designs written by other members of my team, asking probing, insightful questions that solidify choices and surface erroneous assumptions
- I effectively and quickly debug cross-module issues, and may intuit where bugs might lie due to my deep knowledge of the libraries, platforms, and systems that my software relies on 

# Responsibilities
- I deliver many of my team’s goals on time and with a high standard of quality
- My understanding of the business context and my team’s goals enable me to have the greatest customer impact and allows me to make independent technical decisions in the face of open-ended requirements
- I can identify when my results aren't moving the needle for our business/team goals or serving the needs of customers in a meaningful way and work with manager to redirect my focus
- I get work to a simple place by focusing on the heart of the problem and prioritizing the right things
- I proactively identify new opportunities and advocate for and implement improvements to the current state of projects — potentially having broader business impact across teams or products
- I make informed decisions by consulting the right stakeholders and balancing details with the big picture
