	Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle.

Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I.
This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not.
General description and data are available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">Kaggle</a>.<br>Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.</p>

	Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo! is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem: based on information about monsters we predict their types. A fun competition for Halloween. General description and data are available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo">Kaggle</a>.<br>This dataset has little number of samples, so careful feature selection and model ensemble are necessary for high accuracy.

	Otto Group Product Classification Challenge is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem. Based on information about products we predict their category. General description and data are available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge">Kaggle</a>.<br>The data is obfuscated, so the main questionlies in the selection of the model for prediction.

<p>
In real world it is common to meet data in which some classes are more common and others are rarer. In case of a serious disbalance prediction rare classes could be difficult using standard classification methods. In this notebook I analyse such a situation. I can&#39;t share the data, used in this analysis.

	Banks strive to increase the efficiency of their contacts with customers. One of the areas which require this is offering new products to existing clients (cross-selling). Instead of offering new products to all clients, it is a good idea to predict the probability of a positive response. Then the offers could be sent to those clients, for whom the probability of response is higher than some threshold value.<br>In this notebook I try to solve this problem.
