Skateboarding had a bad reputation for many years before Louis Vuitton used [it in their ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWydT-BNbQo). Today, it managed to get attention from all corners of the media landscape, and is now even only one step away to become an [Olympic discipline](http://theridechannel.com/news/2016/06/skateboarding-olympics-tokyo-2020). While for decades the typical competition format was that skaters were judged on their run, Street league Skateboarding established a whole new data driven model to judge the performance of each street skater. Instead of only being rated on the run on the skate course, Street League introduced a real time rating system, single tricks evaluation, and a statistical evaluation of the scoring for each skater.

# The secrets of the game: Strategy

This kind of competition format requires a lot more strategic planning. An analysis of the run-section and best-trick scores across the recent Street League contests suggests that if they are performing well in either one of these sections, the normally perform badly in the other one. This is both true for the preliminaries as well as for the finals.

We can see that Chaz Ortiz and Shane O'Neill know how to perform well in the run section (mainly due to their vast experience in conventional skate contests), while Kevin Hoefler and Manny Santiago do well in the best-trick section. All-rounders such as Nyjah Huston and Luan Oliveira seem to do well in both sections, despite an overall negative coefficient of -0.49.

Unexperienced Street League skaters, so called rookies, don't know how to release their potential at the right time and not to waste important energy on the wrong tricks.

# Street League's evolution

Launched in 2010, Street League Skateboarding is now an international competitive series in professional skateboarding. The SLS ISX, which is the core of the concept, is best described as a real time scoring system, allowing to include each trick independently, in contrast to all other professional contests that grade on overall impression of a full run or series of tricks performed within a certain time frame. Because the outcome change to the last trick, the audience is kept in their seats and a lot more excitement is offered. In addition, the audience can much better understand how and why the skaters were judged. Both adds to the excitement of the game. To win, skaters have to have a strategy and be smart about it when to launch the big tricks, how to coordinate their strengths and weaknesses.

Comparing 2015 with 2016, there is overall little change. If we look at leading Street league winner Nyjah Huston, we learn that he tried out different strategies for different tournaments. He score higher in 2016.

Shane O'Neill improved his best trick scores.

Paul Rodriguez kept being consistent, and performed medium well on both sections.

If a skater is strikingly good at the run section, but fails to succeed in the best trick section (or vice versa), he (or she, female Street League was introduced in 2015) is unlikely to win. Do skaters perform moderately well in both sections, then the final score won't help to success either.

So what is the best strategy to win? To answer the question, it helps to look at coefficients and relationships of data points for the previous events (from 2015 onwards mainly, as the format changed back then).
