In the run up to the French election, Marine Le Pen and her party National Front need all the help they can find. In the web’s social media’s sphere, they seem to have found their megaphone for the masses. Amid fellow fascist and nationalist parties in other countries, Facebook has become a popular medium to boost people’s engagement. It permits to woo new subscribes and to win votes – or likes - for their corrosive and poisonous political views. 

While the media seemed to have understood that Facebook has become a boon and a cesspit of fascist at a time of populist uprisings and electoral upsets, some countries seem to offer a more favourable climate for nationalist parties to rule the a nations web and citizens minds, than others.

Chart: Linear relationship between number of Facebook users per country and Facebook likes of populist nationalist party’s Facebook page

A data analysis that gauges Facebook likes for nationalist political parties (per thousand Facebook users) against countries’ Facebook populations, found a positive linear relationship among those two measures. 

This permitted to split apart winners above the linear regression line from loser nationalist parties, lacking in public support. The pool of data points consisted of 56 European nationalist parties. Little more than five likes per 1,000 Facebook users does it take to reach the median value of 5.5*, and a little less than 10.8 to be average. With 14 likes per 1,000 French Facebook users, National Front positioned in the leading quarter of succeeding national parties above average. Slightly better performed UK’s Eurosceptic and right-wing populist political party UKIP, scoring 15.4 likes, that became the allegory for the Brexit movement. Its impressive count of Facebook likes amounted to more than 14 times the size of its currently assumed party membership.

Chart: point plot

Although, Geert Wilder’s official Party for Freedom Facebook page in the Netherlands could only count a sobering 0.27 per 1,000 Dutch users, many more of its 9.5 million Facebook population supports Wilder’s personal Facebook page. With 19 Facebook likes per 1,000 users, his fan page would rank among the top 10 of political nationalist parties in the sample. 

Jobbik, the Movement for a Better Hungary, the country's radical nationalist political party was among the parties that was one of the most successful to allure to its population. 73 Hungarian users per 1,000 Facebookers boosted the parties online presence. While Hungary’s population of nearly 10 million is relatively small to other European neighbours, its Facebook community - a whopping 5,100,000 - is extensive. The phenomena of large relative Facebook support in yet small European countries could be witnessed in a number of other northern and eastern European countries (or adjoining) such as Norway, Slovenia, Serbia and Moldavia. 


*not accounting for the large outlier, the National Liberal Party of Moldova, that was excluded to not skew the samples mean of 11 likes per 1,000 facebook users.
