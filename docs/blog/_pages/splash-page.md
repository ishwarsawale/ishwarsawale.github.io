> Let the data speak

I use this blog as an innovation lab for new data stories and novel data journalism approaches. Machine learning, new technology and explorative data analysis shall be the core of these posts. All ideas and thoughts shared on this blog are my own.

# Who am I?

I currently work as a digital data journalist and developer at the Economist and only run this blog in my spare time, much to my amusement. My passion is to tell new, untold stories with data.

# Tools:

For the analysis, scraping and machine learning part, I use R and python, for publishing graphics on the web I use JavaScript and D3.js, for big data Spark with R, for graph-data Neo4J and for geo stuff QGIS, Mapbox.js and D3.js. Some code and data are available on my Github (and some are on Gitlab).
